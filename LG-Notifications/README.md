LG Optimus 2X/Black Notifications
=================================
An Android application for LG Optimus 2X/T-Mobile G2X/Star (P990/P999/SU660) and LG Optimus Black (P970). This application uses mainly the touch LED buttons to show if there is any missed notifications by turning them on and off. Vibrator and notification ringtones are supported. It is enabled by default and will autostart on boot but has to be run once after installation to start the service.

Where to start
==============
For UI-preferences the files in `com.martinborjesson.o2xtouchlednotifications.ui.*` and the `main_preferences.xml`-file is where you should look. The `MainPreferences`-class is quite a mess unfortunately so it can be a bit difficult to find anything there.
For the service itself have a look in `MainService`.
Feedbacks (LED-pulse, vibrator and notification ringtone) can be found in `com.martinborjesson.o2xtouchlednotifications.feedbacks`.
Notifications (Gmail, SMS/MMS and missed calls) can be found in `com.martinborjesson.o2xtouchlednotifications.notifications`.
